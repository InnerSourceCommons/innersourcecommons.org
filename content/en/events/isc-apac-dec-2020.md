### 2nd and 3rd December 2020, online - [event site](https://eventyay.com/e/3dbaaa50)!

The 12th InnerSource Commons Summit was our first summit timed for our growing APAC community. Thanks to the success of the <a href="https://youtu.be/0YzOz94cNec">ISC Online Fall Summit 2020</a>, we stayed online and recorded all the talks that you can now enjoy on our Youtube Channel in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA82AFyIaUA&list=PLCH-i0B0otNSA4KltJHgcQB6450VI-8pG">InnerSource Commons APAC Online Summit 2020</a> Playlist.

### The following information is for reference purposes only.

We continue to explore new ways to get together and keep advancing in the body of knowledge of InnerSource. Nowadays, particularly in this industry, it
is more important than ever to successfully work remotely and across different geographical areas. This online event has this in mind and we hope to learn from
each other, what it is working and what it is not.

### Call For Sponsorship

We invite interested organisations and companies to sponsor our summits. These summits provide a basis to encourage InnerSource practitioners to share their experiences and to collaborate with each other on improving InnerSource. If interested in sponsoring this event, please contact our Sponsorship team for more details (sponsor@innersourcecommons.org).

### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.

### Who should attend?

The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer. The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.

### What will I get from this event?

The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:

* Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption
* Share your experiences and get help with your challenges
* Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!
