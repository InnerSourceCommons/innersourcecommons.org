### Scholarship and Funding

<p> For this year’s InnerSource Summit, we are unable to offer travel funding or in-person attendance scholarships. However, to support broader participation, we are providing Diversity Access Tickets for online attendance. 
These tickets are designed to help individuals from underrepresented or marginalized communities join the summit virtually at no cost. You can opt in for a diversity access ticket via the [Online Registration Page.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/innersource-summit-2025-tickets-1383865622329?utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&utm-medium=discovery&utm-term=listing&utm-source=cp&aff=ebdsshcopyurl) <p/>
