subtitle: "Our Partners are organizations helping to lead the InnerSource movement in the world. Our Supporters have not just adopted InnerSource internally, they care about enabling the worldwide community of practitioners. Whereas the InnerSource Commons would not exist without our fabulous community participants, our generous sponsors provide the means by which we can scale our activities and impact. Without their help, we would not be able to do the work we do. </p>Thank you!"

      At Analog Devices, we believe strongly in the power of InnerSource to accelerate innovation and improve developer experience. ISC has been a key partner for us to connect with likeminded companies industry-wide and collaboratively drive best practices. We believe that ISC continues to be the right steward for that vision.

      {{< company name="GitHub" image="/images/logos/github.png" author_name="Zack Koppert" author_title="Senior Engineering Manager at GitHub, Open Source Program Office, GitHub" >}}
      For GitHub, sponsoring the InnerSource Commons is one of the many ways that we are investing in making software better for everyone. We believe that collaborative software development leads to the best outcomes whether thatâ€™s open source or InnerSource. So for us, supporting the InnerSource Commons is core to what we are trying to do as a company. The support that is offered to each other by the InnerSource community and the structured assets like patterns and books are tangible outcomes that we have seen huge benefits from for the industry. That real impact is exactly what we want to expand as we support the InnerSource Commons.
