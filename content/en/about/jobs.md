TInnerSource and the InnerSource Commons are on the rise.  InnerSource is [moving up the Gartner hype cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-11-28-gartner-hype-cycle-shows-ai-practices-and-platform-engineering-will-reach-mainstream-adoption-in-software-engineering-in-two-to-five-years?mc_cid=0fc03067bf&mc_eid=d4411f3314) and was listed first in the [2023 top technology trends](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/gartner-identifies-the-top-strategic-technology-trends-in-software-engineering-trends-for-2023).  Nearly daily, we see new people join the [InnerSource Commons Slack](https://innersourcecommons.org/slack), which now numbers over 3,000 registered participants.  These people are the volunteers that help the InnerSource Commons to fulfill its [mission](https://innersourcecommons.org/about/) through their participation in and leadership of [working groups](https://innersourcecommons.org/community/), local communities, and the other open projects and programs of the InnerSource Commons.


To encourage and amplify the work of these volunteers, the InnerSource Commons needs a community manager to support them.  Through encouragement, structure, and servant leadership, you will encourage volunteers to engage with the InnerSource Commons and remove 	barriers to their work so that they can produce output that simultaneously benefits InnerSource in the industry, the InnerSource Commons, their employer, and their own personal interests.
