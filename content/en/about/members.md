The InnerSource Commons (ISC) community is open to all. Some community participants go above and beyond, and may be invited to become an ISC Member.
The InnerSource Commons is a membership corporation, so ISC Members serve a similar role as shareholders in publicly traded corporations.

Members have particular rights in the ISC; for example, they may vote in board elections.
To be eligible for Membership, a person must be nominated by a current Member.
Membership is purely merit-based, free of any cost, and restricted to individuals.
