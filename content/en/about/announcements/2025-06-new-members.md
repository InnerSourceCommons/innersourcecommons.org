**New Members Appointed to the InnerSource Commons Foundation**

We are excited to announce our new InnerSource Commons (ISC) Foundation Members: Niall Maher, Shoma Kubo, Arthur Fücher, Yoshitake Kobayashi, Ryo Ashikawa, Fernando Correa, Regina Nkenchor, and Dr. Wolfgang Gehring.

The InnerSource Commons community welcomes everyone. However, certain individuals are nominated and invited to become ISC Foundation Members as a way of honoring their significant contributions to the Foundation.

Much like the model used by the Apache Software Foundation, existing ISC Members identify and nominate key contributors each year, followed by a vote to bring in new Members. Membership is based solely on merit and is granted to individuals only.

Since InnerSource Commons is structured as a membership-based organization, ISC Members collectively own and govern the Foundation (similar to how shareholders operate in a public company.)

Each of these new Members has played a pivotal role in growing and strengthening InnerSource Commons, each bringing their unique talents—whether by championing our mission, expanding our working groups, sharing insights and experiences, or creating tools and resources that support the global InnerSource community.

“At InnerSource Commons, every new Member brings not just energy and ideas—but new possibilities. Together, we are growing a global, diverse, and welcoming community. Whether you're just joining or still exploring, we’re excited about the future we’re building with you. Let’s shape the next chapter of InnerSource—together,” said Yuki Hattori, President of InnerSource Commons. 

“We’re thrilled to welcome the newest members of the InnerSource Commons Foundation. Their meaningful contributions and enthusiastic involvement have greatly enriched our community. We deeply appreciate their continued support,” said Daniel Izquierdo-Cortázar, Chair of InnerSource Commons.
