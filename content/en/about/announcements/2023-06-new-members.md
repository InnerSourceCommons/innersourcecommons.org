We are delighted to announce the election of our new InnerSource Commons (ISC) Foundation [Members](https://innersourcecommons.org/about/members/): Guilherme Dellagustin, Yuki Hattori, Bill Higgins and Katie Schueths.

The InnerSource Commons community is open to all. However, some community participants go above and beyond, and may be invited to become ISC Foundation Members. As the InnerSource Commons is a membership corporation, ISC Members own and run the Foundation, serving a similar role to shareholders in publicly traded corporations.

“We are delighted to welcome our newest InnerSource Commons Foundation Members. Guilherme, Yuki, Bill, and Katie have all made significant contributions to the InnerSource Commons and we truly appreciate their dedication and support.” said Daniel Izquierdo-Cortázar, President of InnerSource Commons.

The ISC Foundation follows the practice of the Apache Software Foundation. ISC Members nominate key contributors to InnerSource Commons and vote in new Members on an annual basis. Membership is purely merit-based, and restricted to individuals.

“Our Members are crucial stakeholders within InnerSource Commons. It is fantastic to see more Members join us every year,” said Isabel Drost-Fromm, Chair of InnerSource Commons.

The full list of InnerSource Commons Members can be found on our [Members](https://innersourcecommons.org/about/members/) page.
