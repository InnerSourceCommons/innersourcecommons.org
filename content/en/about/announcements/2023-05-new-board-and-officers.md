The InnerSource Commons Foundation is delighted to announce the election of a new Board of Directors and Officers comprising of Isabel Drost-Fromm (Chair), Daniel Izquierdo Cortazar (President), Russ Rutledge (Vice President) Tom Sadler (Secretary), Sebastian Spier (Assistant Secretary), Matt Cobby, Georg Grütter, Yuki Hattori, and Dmitrii Sugrobov. We would also like to congratulate our returning Officers: Silona Bonewald (Treasurer) and Maximilian Capraro (Assistant Treasurer).

We welcome Matt Cobby, Yuki Hattori and Dmitrii Sugborov who are joining the board for the first time.

The Board of Directors and Officers have been elected by the InnerSource Commons Members as the best people to set and drive the vision of the foundation through the next year. Our Officers play an essential role in helping us implement that vision.

Danese Cooper, our founder, is stepping down from the InnerSource Commons Board for the coming term. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Danese for her dedicated efforts in advancing InnerSource Commons and raising awareness about InnerSource. We know that Danese will continue to share her insights and advice with the community.

We are also deeply grateful to Jacob Green, Klaas-Jan Stol and Johannes Tigges, who are stepping down from the Board this year. The Foundation has truly benefited from their perspectives and their expertise.

“InnerSource Commons is a community for those who not only wish to learn from their peers, but also for those who have the passion to contribute to the growing body of InnerSource knowledge. Our Board of Directors and elected Officers play a vital role in helping us fulfill the InnerSource Commons mission. We would like to thank them for volunteering in these roles, past and present,” said Daniel Izquierdo, President of The InnerSource Commons Foundation.
