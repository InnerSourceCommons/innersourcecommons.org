We are delighted to announce our new InnerSource Commons (ISC) Foundation Members: Addie Girouard, Brittany Istenes, Chan Voong, Jeff Bailey, Justin Gosses, Thomas Froment and Willem Jiang.

The InnerSource Commons community is open to all. However, some community participants are nominated and invited to become ISC Foundation Members in recognition of their valuable contributions to the Commons.

Following the practice of the Apache Software Foundation, ISC Members nominate key contributors to InnerSource Commons and vote in new Members on an annual basis. Membership is purely merit-based, and restricted to individuals.

As the InnerSource Commons is a membership corporation, ISC Members own and run the Foundation, serving a similar role to shareholders in publicly traded corporations.

Each new Member has shaped and advanced InnerSource Commons using their own unique skills and expertise - from promoting our work and what we do; to building the capacity of our working groups; to sharing valuable learning; or to creating resources that benefit InnerSource practitioners everywhere.

“We are delighted to welcome our newest InnerSource Commons Foundation Members. Addie, Brittany, Chan, Jeff, Justin, Thomas and Willem have all made significant contributions to InnerSource Commons. We are truly grateful for their active participation and ongoing contributions to the Commons,” said Daniel Izquierdo-Cortázar, President of InnerSource Commons.

“Congratulations to our new InnerSource Commons Members. Our Members are crucial stakeholders within the Foundation and the wider InnerSource community. It’s very exciting to see more Members join us every year,” said Isabel Drost-Fromm, Chair of InnerSource Commons.
