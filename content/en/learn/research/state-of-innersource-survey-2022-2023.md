The ‘State of InnerSource 2023’ survey was conducted from November 2022 to January 2023. Over 100 respondents answered the survey and provided a snapshot of their InnerSource journey.

This research represents a diverse set of experiences from across the globe. It provides an overview of how the InnerSource Commons community is approaching InnerSource, and also how InnerSource fits within their own organizations’ strategic direction.

The report takes a global view of our community’s InnerSource trajectory from first steps to team readiness and adoption.  It also shares data on InnerSource practices in most common use, benefits experienced and success measures and metrics.

Thank you to all the respondents who gave their valuable time to answer our survey.

We are deeply grateful to Clare Dillon, the primary author of this report. We also extend our thanks and appreciation to those who actively promoted the survey and contributed to the survey design, analysis, writing support and review of the report – Addie Girouard, Ciara Flanagan, Cristina Coffey, Dmitrii Sugrobov, Guilherme Dellagustin, Katie Schueths, Klaas-Jan Stol, Lawrence Hecht, Niall Maher, Tom Sadler and Zack Koppert.

If you want to discuss the findings further, do come join us in the [InnerSource Commons Slack](/slack); it’s the perfect place to share and learn from others who are leading InnerSource practices worldwide.
