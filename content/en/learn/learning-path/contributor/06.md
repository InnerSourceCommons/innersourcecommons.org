<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks for reviewing the Contributor segment of the InnerSource Commons Learning Path. With this section you&#8217;ve learned about the Contributor role - the life blood of InnerSource projects.  Contributors are external to the component owners' team, and they bring additional valuable input to the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section you&#8217;ve learned about how to become a contributor by finding opportunities to contribute.
We have reviewed the mindset and habits needed to find or create such opportunities.
We&#8217;ve also discussed the ethos of the role and a suggested approach that is likely to lead to successful contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given the right mindset, habits and ethos, there are still a few details that might keep you from successfully contributing - hence, we&#8217;ve discussed these nuts and bolts in greater detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, convincing your teammates and your organization at various levels can be hard, thus we&#8217;ve discussed the benefits of contribution from various perspectives to make this process easier for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed watching the videos, and/or and reading the articles, and will be able to take away some interesting new insights for your journey towards InnerSource and being a good contributor.</p>
