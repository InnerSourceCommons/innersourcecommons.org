The InnerSource Commons Learning Path community is focused on creating a set of resources explaining and teaching various aspects of InnerSource. This curated set of videos and articles cover patterns that have been adopted by many organisations and have been proven to lead to successful InnerSource practices. Many of our community use these resources within their organisations to increase awareness and build competencies around InnerSource.
