The research community has been a strong ally of the InnerSource Commons ever since. The researchers have taken great interest in learning more about how companies are applying InnerSource. Their discoveries have greatly improved our collective understanding of how InnerSource helps companies to improve.

## [State of InnerSource 2020](/documents/surveys/State.of.InnerSource.Report.2020.pdf)

The 2020 State of the InnerSource Survey was conducted as a checkpoint to assess how the InnerSource community is shaping up, what we have been doing right, and what aspects need improvement.

The goal of the survey was to address three main questions:

1. What is the state of InnerSource adoption across different organizations?
2. What factors influence the success of InnerSource adoption?
3. What are the main obstacles for adopting InnerSource?

Since a number of studies already documented the Key Factors for InnerSource success in detail, we focused more on exploring the key motivations for contributors and the obstacles.
