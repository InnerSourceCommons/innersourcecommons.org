The goal of the survey was to address three main questions:

1. What is the state of InnerSource adoption across different organizations?
1. What factors influence the success of InnerSource adoption?
1. What are the main obstacles for adopting InnerSource?

Since a number of studies already documented the Key Factors for InnerSource success in detail, we focused more on exploring the key motivations for contributors and the obstacles.
