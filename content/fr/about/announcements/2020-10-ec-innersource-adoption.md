The InnerSource Commons welcomes the [European Commission's new Open Source Software Strategy 2020-2023](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/en_ec_open_source_strategy_2020-2023.pdf) highlighting how InnerSource (the creation of working cultures based on open source) is an integral part of a robust open source strategy and ecosystem. Teams adopting a culture of InnerSource can accelerate active open source corporate participation.  We fully support the intention to set InnerSource as a default way of working in order to bring teams closer to open source working methods and to encourage sharing and reuse within the organisation. We agree that InnerSource can be instrumental to the success of this strategy.
 
"InnerSource is rapidly gaining momentum as a way to help developers on their path to open source. It can be a great tool to help break down silos, encourage collaboration and reuse of code, and to identify opportunities to contribute software back to the open source world. We welcome the European Commission's decision to adopt and promote InnerSource. We hope the community-created resources from the InnerSource Commons community will aid the Commission in their implementation of this strategy, and we look forward to learning from the Commission about their own best practices." said Danese Cooper, President of InnerSource Commons.
