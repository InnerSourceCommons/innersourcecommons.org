InnerSource Commons is an independent non-for-profit organisation that creates and shares knowledge about InnerSource for its members. 

This privacy policy will explain how our organisation uses the personal data we collect from you when you use our website and contribute to our projects.

## What Data Do We Collect And Why?

You directly provide InnerSource Commons with most of the data we collect. We collect and process data when you:

- Register to our emailing list: InnerSource Commons collects personal identification information (Name and Email Address) to email you with news, events and articles we think you might like.

- Register to our events: InnerSource Commons collects information that you provide us when you register for one of our events, such as conferences and when you choose to participate in an event as an attendee, speaker, or sponsor. This information includes personal data such as your name, company, and contact information.

- Join our Slack community: When you join the conversation on Slack we store the information you contribute and your conversations.

- Voluntarily contribute to our GitHub Repositories by providing feedback, content or committing code: When you contribute source code, documentation, or other materials to one of our projects (whether on your own behalf or on behalf of your employer), we store the information and content that you contribute. This can include the contributed materials, information required to confirm the provenance of the contribution, and any associated intellectual property. We ask you not to upload personal data to our projects.

- Voluntarily answer questionnaires and surveys: From time to time we may send you questionnaires or surveys for collecting demographic information or assessing your interests and needs, to help us to improve our services. Any such questionnaires or surveys will be entirely voluntary. The purpose and intended use of the information being collected will be explained in the survey itself.

### Service Providers

We employ other organizations and service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf. These third parties have only limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are obligated to InnerSource Commons not to disclose or use your information for other purposes.

## Legal Compliance / Protection of the Public and Our Business / Legitimate Interests 

We will release personal and account information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet legitimate national security or law enforcement requirements; to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, including to collect a debt; to comply with a subpoena, court order, legal process, or other legal requirement; or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud and threats to our property.

In limited circumstances, we may also exchange certain information with other companies and organizations for the specific purpose of fraud protection. However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from you for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth here.

We may also share your information during an organizational transaction like a merger or sale of our assets. If such a transaction occurs, we will provide notification of any changes to control of your information, as well as choices you may have.

## Children’s Privacy

Our services are not designed for, and are not marketed to, people under the age of 18 (“minors”). We do not knowingly collect or ask for information from minors and we do not knowingly allow minors to use our services. By using our services or accessing our website, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your country, state and/or province of residence.

## Data Transfers

InnerSource Commons is based in the United States, processes and stores data in the United States, and makes its services available around the world. The United States, Member States of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and other countries are governed by different laws. When your data is moved from its home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country where you reside. For example, the legal requirements for law enforcement to gain access to personal information may vary between countries. If your personal data is in the United States, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with United States law.

Because we offer our services to people in different countries and use technical infrastructure based in the United States, we may need to transfer your personal information across borders in order to deliver our services.

## How Secure Is Your Information?

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the privacy and security of the information we maintain about you. When you provide us with personal information, the connection between your computer and our server is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software that encrypts that information. We use a Digital Certificate and secure pages will be identified by a padlock sign and “https://” in the address bar. We store our data in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access. We also use hardware and software firewalls, screen for viruses and malware, and utilize live 24/7 monitoring services to mitigate threats. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. 

All accounts used to access InnerSource Commons related resources are maintained by the vendors providing those resources; InnerSource Commons does not store any passwords on your behalf. It is very important for you to protect against the theft or unauthorized access of your account credentials for these services. 

## What Are Your Rights?

Upon request, InnerSource Commons will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. In certain cases, subject to relevant legal rights, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal information, to request changes, corrections, or the deletion of your personal information, and to obtain a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format. In order to do this, you can contact us using the contact information set out at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to every request within a reasonable timeframe and may need to take reasonable steps to confirm identity before proceeding.

We offer you the opportunity to receive information about our company and projects that we think may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish to receive such information then we will stop sending it. Any emails that we send contain an obvious means of unsubscribing from further messages, with a link appearing at the bottom of the email. 

## Data Retention

For personal data under its control, InnerSource Commons will retain such data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this policy.

If you no longer wish to use our services then you may request deletion of your data at any time.
