        <p>The InnerSource Commons community is open to all. Some community participants go above and beyond, and may be invited to become an ISC Member. The InnerSource Commons is aÂ membership corporation, so ISC Members serve a similar role as shareholders in publicly traded corporations. </p>
        <p>Members have particular rights in the ISC; for example, they may vote in board elections. To be eligible for Membership, a person must be nominated by a current Member. Membership is purely merit-based, free of any cost, and restricted to individuals.
