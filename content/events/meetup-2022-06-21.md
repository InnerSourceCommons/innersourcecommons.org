In place of our usual community call, on June, 21st (5pm BST / 6pm CEST / 9:30 pm IST/ 12am PST) we are partnering with FINOS to bring you a Panel discussion on the topic of InnerSource in Financial Services.
Clare Dillon (InnerSource Commons) will guide the conversation between Jesús Alonso Gutiérrez (Santander), Gilles Gravier (Wipro), Vinesh Kumar (Fidelity) and Arthur Maltson(Capital One) focusing on the reasons Financial Institutions are investing in InnerSource, the benefits experienced, and the best way to kick-start your own InnerSource practice.
