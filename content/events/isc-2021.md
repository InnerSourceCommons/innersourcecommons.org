Join us at the world's largest InnerSource Conference! 

InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. The InnerSource Commons (ISC) is the world's largest community of InnerSource practitioners, who have come together with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge about InnerSource. You can join the community at www.innersourcecommons.org.

We come together at our summits to learn and share experiences. We've missed seeing everyone in person over the past 2 years, but we are looking forward to seeing everyone online at this year's virtual summit. Join us there to...

- Hear about global trends in InnerSource.
- Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption.
- Share your own experience and meet like-minded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success within their respective organizations.

InnerSource has brought a new way to become more effective at the macro level by discovering and re-using existing software or scaling agile teams. The benefits are well known, as increasing the general engagement, being more innovative, giving space and empowering developers, and creating new more-technical oriented careers as the role of the Trusted Committer.

Specifically, at the InnerSource Commons, we can find specific literature (e.g., patterns working group) giving insights for different roles in the community as the Product Owner or the Trusted Committer, but not that much focus on detailing the end to end of a software product that needs to become a service for customers.

This talk aims at opening this discussion at the Commons with the goal of creating a common model that fits the InnerSource requirements, but at the same time makes sense from a software product line perspective.

When defining the end-to-end model, this has to be open, transparent and foster collaboration by default. This has to create forums for discussion, spaces to safely share ideas and concepts across the organization. And this has to fit with each organization requirements (e.g., regulated environments).

National Australia Bank started its InnerSource journey in 2019 as an initiative to reduce duplication and increase re-use of tooling. Since then our InnerSource programme has become a strategic part of our NAB Engineering Foundations. On the way, we have learned many lessons and are exploring how to make it part of every engineer's working experience and a sustainable community.

Didi developed InnerSource since July 2019, and, at the same time, Didi InnerSource Committee activated the operating mechanism and constructed a platform in support of inner cooperation. However, can the InnerSource culture be established only with the call of tech leaders? How to activate the programmers to participate in the InnerSource culture construction under no KPI standard and encouragement as usual? Can merely the Top-down exhortation promote the InnerSource development? The answer is definitely no. The combination of Down-top recognition with a Top-down guide is what we believe is the magic that can lead to the success of InnerSource development. Therefore, Didi proposed that “We should cultivate the InnerSource community by adapting to the paradigm of open source community Development” and has carried out a series of practices. For instance, we established an InnerSource community like group chat for sharing news; we used our InnerSource website to provide incentives through individual, project, and departmental dimensions; we take advantage of 1024 Programmer's Day to popularize InnerSource ideas. After nearly 2 years of InnerSource operation, we finally laid a solid programmer foundation. They understand open collaboration, utilize the InnerSource tool, and are able to produce high-quality InnerSource projects collaboratively with multiple departments as the result. From the perspective of a company, it brings about some actual value, which stimulates the company to be more supportive of InnerSource development and governance.

We hear it time and time again: culture change is critical to a successful InnerSource program and is also one of the hardest but most beneficial parts of getting this right. Thankfully, you don’t have to do it alone. In this talk I’ll discuss how you can work with your HR team to establish policies and rewards that can help motivate team members of all levels to take the right steps on your InnerSource journey.

Back in 2016 we kicked off our first attempt at InnerSource by starting to build a tool that would bring all of fragmented source code together into a single catalog. We had source code scattered along different systems and technologies so the idea was to interface with each of these and surface all of the code we had by publishing the code in a catalog.

We spent effort and time creating processes and practices to enable our existing teams and businesses to share and contribute to their code through that catalog interface. We listened to the concerns of all the businesses and incorporated their feedback into these processes. However, it didn't scale up as expected, we had limited engagement and the culture change we hoped for was nowhere in sight.

We took a step back and realized that we were trying to add InnerSource to existing processes without changing the culture and the way people collaborate. We also tried to keep our existing tool stacks and tailor them to make InnerSource work. This had its own problems too. We realized that the tools we use are a key part in igniting the culture change we were looking for.

In this second attempt, we are taking all those good lessons learned, as well from other in the industry, and ensure both culture as well the tools are addressed when enabling InnerSource.

We implement DevOps to optimize the delivery of products; the intent is to let Dev and Ops function as one team and drive structural continuous improvement. While useful and necessary to enable the Product Mindset, it is not enough for a high performing organization. With InnerSource, we implement the glue between the DevOps teams, allowing the organization to benefit from shared experience, technology intelligence, easier compliance with quality, security and user experience standards, elimination of duplication, and more consistency, which also leads to accelerated onboarding, higher transparency of work done, improved productivity, and a competitive edge in the hunt for talent. InnerSource is collective knowledge through connected communities. We need to establish an ecosystem and nurture behaviours that emphasize the importance of InnerSource, where contributors feel respected, included, and recognized for their merits.

For many organizations, InnerSource is a new concept, removed from the lexicons familiar to those in management. However, other terms such as Agile and DevOps are better recognized and there is much written on adoption of those disciplines. This talk briefly outlines some commonalities between Agile and DevOps and introduces strategies that can be used for repurposing existing material to aid InnerSource adoption.

Open source has been massively adopted by the banking industry in the last years and Santander Bank is part of this movement. Several open source technologies are now used and standardize as part of the bank toolchain and in the software development life cycle. However, the movement from a consumer role to an active open source producer one is far from being reached. This cultural change and strategic way of thinking is now changing the way the bank develops software. And this is aligned with the expectations at several levels: executives, middle managers, and developers. We are far from creating open source, but InnerSource is helping nowadays to build a common set of rules and processes, new ways of thinking through transparency and fostering collaboration, and tools to follow a similar developer experience across countries.

This talk will share barriers found when adopting InnerSource principles within a bank as Santander and the mitigation strategies we're following to make this happen. With full support from upper management, and a high developers and middle-managers engagement, the main pain point is about how to build together in a more open source way.

More organizations across all industries are seeking different ways to build relationships with the open source ecosystem. Based on the results from the last OSPO 2021 survey, there is an increasing number of non-software organizations interested in investing and implementing open source initiatives. However, such implementation usually comes with a big sense of uncertainty when OS advocates try to convince their colleges and supervisors.

One of the ways some organizations might consider to overcome this challenge, is to start simple and begin to foster an open-source culture within the walls of the organization (AKA InnerSource). Those who cultivate InnerSource initiatives and use them as the first step in their open source journey, may find easier to build an Open Source Program Office.

Can InnerSource improve OSPOs adoption? How can we achieve this? What role should the different organizations, communities, and foundations play here? During this talk, Ana will share with the ISC Community some of the insights from the last OSPO survey and bring a discussion on how the different InnerSource and OSPO communities can work together to build a common path to guide emerging OSPOs on its open source journey, using InnerSource as the main ingredient to initiate healthy and sustainable open source initiatives.

InnerSource is easy, right? All we need to do is make our repositories public and our users will flood us with contributions. Unfortunately it's not as easy as this. In this session, I’ll review our journey to opening up a collection of older proprietary Java libraries to user contributions. I’ll talk about the differences between managing a repository where the same small number of developers worked on the code to one where any Morgan Stanley developer could pull the code and contribute. I’ll look at the benefits we’ve gained from going down the innersource road, as well as some of the potholes along the way.
