InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. The InnerSource Commons (ISC) is the world's largest community of InnerSource practitioners, who have come together with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge about InnerSource. You can join the community on **[slack](https://join.slack.com/t/innersourcecommons/shared_invite/zt-1htfuq036-Uq22qnDHA6kydBvk_C5PUw).**

We come together at our summits to learn and share experiences. Join us there to...
