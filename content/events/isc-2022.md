Join us at the world's largest InnerSource Conference!

To ensure we reach the maximum number of people, InnerSource Summit 2022 will be virtual. Nowadays, particularly in our industry, it is more important than ever to successfully work remotely and across different geographical areas. This year's InnerSource Summit will encourage learning and sharing experiences in online environments that facilitate our remote work. 

We are looking forward to meeting and learning from each other, what it is working and what it is not.


### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from over 500 companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.
