**Join us at the world's leading gathering of InnerSource practitioners.**

**[Get Your Ticket Now!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/innersource-summit-2022-tickets-432500048287)**

InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. The InnerSource Commons (ISC) is the world's largest community of InnerSource practitioners, who have come together with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge about InnerSource. You can join the community on **[slack](https://join.slack.com/t/innersourcecommons/shared_invite/zt-1htfuq036-Uq22qnDHA6kydBvk_C5PUw).**

We come together at our summits to learn and share experiences. Join us there to...

- Hear about global trends in InnerSource.
- Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption.
- Share your own experience and meet like-minded people, all of who are passionate about making InnerSource a success within their respective organizations.

You have decided to start an InnerSource program. What next? The first step to implementing an InnerSource program is to discover what problems are most important to your users. During this session we will look at customer interview questions and how the results can be used to shape the direction of an InnerSource program. Indeed is in the third quarter of our InnerSource program. We created a customer interview to assess the organization's needs, talked to users to identify the pain points they were facing, prioritized the pain points, and compiled a report to show users the direction we were going to take. Transparency is the key to any successful project where you want collaboration. The customer interview put the power to shape the program into the developers hands and ensured they knew they were being heard. Learn how Indeed’s experiences with the initial InnerSource customer interview helped us grow and how you can use a customer interview to help build your InnerSource program.

As software development organizations grow, they face a variety of coordination and collaboration challenges across teams for larger products and projects. Having been involved with numerous automation, consolidation, federation, and developer self-service enablement programs it has become clear that technical solutions are not sufficient alone for scaling large software product development organizations without accompanying changes to how engineers collaborate across teams.

Peter Drucker famously postulated that “if you can't measure it, you can't manage it”. This is true also for our InnerSource efforts. Not only may we be flying in the dark without metrics, but we may struggle to secure support from top-level management and funding for ongoing InnerSource efforts. This talk is about what metrics we can use for our InnerSource Programs. 
We will highlight the industry standard, open source GrimoireLab tool for getting InnerSource Metrics. For each metric we discuss, we will also see how the metric can be interpreted and used for managing InnerSource and securing support and funding for it. This talk will repeat many good practices we’ve previously discussed in the InnerSource Commons with the goal of giving new community members a primer on our growing knowledge base and giving long-time members an opportunity to reflect on their own use of metrics and how they may want to evolve it.

When you’re hearing “Contribution” - most probably, what’s coming up in your mind couple lines of code in some repo. 
But for us, in Playtika after more than a year of active usage InnerSource patterns and practices - we’ve started to discover the true and full power of Contribution in all possible meanings of this word. It’s much more than just about a code - it’s about collaboration. Shared ownership, active participation in Community, feedback, ideas, and started discussions on GitHub - that is what Contribution in Playtika is. 

This approach is reflected in the personal recognition system, the department’s maturity matrix, and Community gamification rules - all across the company. That helped to create shared environment where “Dare to challenge” is a true value

Everyone remembers IBM’s original Watson system that won Jeopardy. Since then, IBM has been evolving Watson to support business use cases, from chat bots to AI-driven search to supply chain to everything in between. In 2019, the Watson team decided to try to use inner source to unify IBM’s development community to work better together, and it’s been transformative. In this presentation, Bill Higgins, Director of Watson Core engineering, will share this journey, and how IBM is now trying to scale inner source to all core technology.

For highly regulated companies, it can be a challenge contributing to open source communities. There are many regulations and challenges with security and data loss prevention to overcome. Furthermore, there are few products or technology solutions that enable easier open source contributions in highly regulated environments. Because all companies rely on critical open source software with security risks, the Fannie Mae OSPO created the open source Clean Dependency Project. The primary goal is to clean up critical dependencies with no "clean" versions available and contribute them to open source communities.

The inverse of this is using InnerSource "Golden Patches" to bring these clean dependencies back inside of the companies firewall to be tested and distributed to multiple teams for consumption and contribution.  

The purpose of this talk is to show how InnerSource and Open Source forms a solid bond for secure, innovative and reliable development.

Collaboration today is challenging at VMware. Teams have the right intent to collaborate but finding information to get started is extremely difficult. With many collaboration and source code management tools to find information, it is easy to get lost in the vast amount of data.

In this session, learn how the InnerSource Program Office at VMware used the Design Thinking approach to understand the problem of discoverability from R&D stakeholders and built a solution based on the learnings from their pain points and key insights. 
Not only did we use the design thinking approach to build the InnerSource portal but also to understand how to move the needle for successful cross-team collaboration at VMware and get the Leadership buy-in.

Come to our session to find out how you can use a Design approach to solve complex collaboration problems with users in mind.

Multinational enterprises (companies with entities in different countries) must be compliant with specific regulations whenever assets, services or intellectual property are transferred between their subsidiaries: The subsidiaries are required to act as if they were independent third parties (“Arm’s Length principle”) and reimburse one another with transfer prices. 

What does that mean for cross-border InnerSource collaboration? For hundreds or thousands of fine-grained InnerSource contributions?

In this talk, we introduce the relevant regulations and discuss why transfer pricing is necessary in InnerSource to stay financially and fiscally compliant. With a fictional case study, we discuss how your InnerSource program can use so-called cost contribution agreements for its transfer pricing approach – emphasizing a pragmatic approach to minimize bureaucratic overhead and limit impediments to InnerSource collaboration.

Is InnerSource inevitable? Danese Cooper has been provocatively asking us this question and, likely, the answer is “Yes”. Even if inevitable, it does not happen overnight. 

Looking back at the history of SAP, sharing code, building reusable software and having cross-organizational collaboration are not novelties, but still, we cannot claim, at the present time, that the company has fully embraced InnerSource. That is changing though, and, in this presentation we will bring light to SAP’s journey, looking back at its past but also at the present, on how we are patiently yet persistently driving InnerSource. 

We cannot give a definitive answer to Danese’s question, but we will share our learnings, challenges, and latest developments – all we are doing to be sure that InnerSource will be indeed inevitable at SAP.

Similar to Open Source, Inner Source could benefit from some well defined/definsible licenses and CLAs to help with adoption of Inner Source development models.

Modern efficient software delivery has become a complex operation in recent years.  With the mentality of “you build it, you run it”, teams now have become experts in Kubernetes, distributed computing, operational resilience, data lineage, observability, security operations, systems architecture, infrastructure design.   That’s all before a line of business logic has been written.  To help teams with the cognitive complexity of running all this, the high performing companies are investing in internal developer platforms. These can range from container run time platforms to operational logistics platforms o application templates that encapsulate the best experience of building and running services. 
These internal platforms take significant investment and time to build and so it’s crucial that they are adopted across the company to gain the benefits.  
Learn how inner source can unlock the benefits of your investment and help stop the platform team from becoming a blocker for your organisation

Antifragile, a term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb talks about "Things that gain from disorder" which describes amongst many things a model for ensuring not only survival but prosperity in an era where the intensity of risks and volatility seems to be increasing daily.

InnerSource projects are powerful because they scale. They scale in impact, as they are more widely adopted than siloed projects, and they scale in quality and function, because of the larger talent pool of contributors.

However, this means that the impact of decisions scales out to your adopters and contributors. Adopters may incur a large amount of work if your API changes drastically, or contributors could find it more difficult to contribute if your development process adopts new tooling.

In BBC iPlayer and Sounds on TV, we have recognised this and strive for transparent and collaborative decision making on our InnerSource projects. We have been examining the various factors that affect how we make decisions, and what methods we use for different types of decision. 

This talk will delve into those factors, some examples of successes and failures of collaborative decision making, and share a practical exercise you can use to run retrospectives on your decisions.

When baking bread with sourdough you are dealing with the sometimes surprizing behavior of wild yeasts, creating a bubbly dough that eventually turns into tasty bread.

Learning how to handle sourdough takes time, practices, and the willingness to experiment and fail. However once you master it, you are rewarded with more healthy bread, richer in flavor and with a longer shelf life!

InnerSource has many similarities in this regards to sourdough.

This talk highlights those similarities in a both thought-provoking and fun way.
And to make everybody hungry there will be a lot of bread pictures ;)

In my career journey before Microsoft, teams have been always talking about having the knowledge sharing assets /documenting learnings at one common place like SharePoint so everyone can leverage it. They also talked about and version controlling the source code. However, we always ended up having multiple copies especially for knowledge sharing assets. When I joined the DevOps Dojo community in Microsoft, I faced a similar issue, everyone working with a customer would have their own copy and those updates would never come back to golden copy. So we never had a single source of truth. Also, the knowledge that DevOps Dojo community members had captured in the PowerPoints could be beneficial to the entire Microsoft colleagues. So, to spread the power of DevOps culture, we started the Innersource movement, and I have been part of it from Day 1 and till now we have all our IP’s Innersource and are being widely leveraged across organization. During my interaction with the customers, I am also able to demonstrate the benefits and hence showing them the ART of possible.

I will share what I have learned and the challenges I have faced in launching a community in Japan.

InnerSource Commons is an international community in the first place, with many enthusiastic engineers and managers participating. But to start InnerSource in a company, you need to get people in the company to understand it. In doing so, local language translations are needed. Not everyone who makes the decision to start an InnerSource program is enthusiastic and speaks English.

The Japanese community is just starting up, so I can't share any solutions or best practices in this session, but I do hope that many people will start international communities outside of Japan through this session.

At face value, InnerSource translates open source methodologies to the way companies develop software internally, but what does it mean to really adopt InnerSource? What does success look like within an InnerSource program? What are some common challenges and hesitations engineers have when making or receiving innersource contributions? And how does one solve these challenges? In this talk, you will learn more about the InnerSource program at Intuit - what it is, what it looks like in practice, and key lessons we learned during the process of adopting innersource.

### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from over 500 companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.

### [Code of Conduct](/about/codeofconduct/)

All participants, vendors, and guests at InnerSource Commons events are required to abide by the [code of conduct](/about/codeofconduct/).
All related conversations in the InnerSource Slack Channel will still be considered to fall under [Chatham House Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): information discussed can be shared but not attributed.
