This book is intended to bring, from a managerial perspective, the several aspects needed when introducing InnerSource methodologies into enterprises.

This book is a work in progress process where anyone is more than welcome to contribute in any possible way. Ideas, comments, typos, full paragraphs or sections would be great. This repository aims at bringing specialized knowledge from the industry within this respect in a way that this is useful for third parties. For this, we are actively looking for reviewers that can help in this process. For those that have already contributed to the book, thanks a lot!

You can find more information about the process in the contributing section.

## About the Author

Each chapter in the book is authored and reviewed by different people. That information can be found at the beginning of each chapter. This initiative is fostered by [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/) although given some technical issues, we finally decided to open this under a personal repository.
