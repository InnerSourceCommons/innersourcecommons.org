InnerSource day at OSCON is a gathering of industry practitioners discussing real-world implementations of this community-inspired, transformational open source approach to software development within the enterprise. InnerSource was inspired by companies seeking to leverage the methods of open source to enhance proprietary software development by fostering better cross-company collaboration. The pervasive spread of open source software throughout operating systems, cloud computing, programming languages, JavaScript frameworks, and elsewhere has caused a number of companies to invest in bringing these successful methods to bear inside their software engineering departments. This special one-day event is centered around 25-minute sessions detailing the experience of those leading the way in the InnerSource movement.
