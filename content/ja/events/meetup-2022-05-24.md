Join us for a stimulating panel discussion on Incentivizing Culture Change, where Micaela Eller (IBM), Wolfgang Gehring (Mercedes Benz) and Katie Schueths (Indeed) will share their own experiences on this topic. Together we will explore the incentives and programmes that worked and the ones that we all learned from.
