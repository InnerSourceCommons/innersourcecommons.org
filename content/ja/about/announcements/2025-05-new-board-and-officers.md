# InnerSource Commons Foundation Announces New Board of Directors

The InnerSource Commons Foundation is pleased to announce the appointment of its Board of Directors for the upcoming term. This announcement reflects the Foundation’s continued commitment to community-driven governance and strategic leadership.
We are honored to welcome back several members who will be continuing in key leadership roles: **Yuki Hattori** (President), **Clare Dillon** (Vice President), **Matt Cobby** (Secretary), **Daniel Izquierdo Cortázar** (Chair), and **Danese Cooper** (Board Member).

In addition, we are grateful that **Tom Sadler** (Assistant Treasurer) and **Georg Grütter** (Treasurer) will remain actively engaged as non-director Foundation officers. Their dedication and expertise have been instrumental to the Foundation’s ongoing success, and we look forward to their continued presence and contribution in the InnerSource Commons.

We are equally excited to welcome four new Board Members who will be joining for their first term: **Addie Girouard**, **Jerry Tan**, **Cristina Coffey**, and **Jeff Bailey**, who will serve as Assistant Secretary.

This blend of returning and new leadership ensures a strong and diverse foundation for advancing the mission of InnerSource Commons. We look forward to their contributions as we continue to grow and support the global InnerSource community.

We also extend our deepest appreciation to our outgoing Board members and Officers, **Katie Schueths** and **Sebastian Spier**, for their outstanding service. Their time, insight, and commitment have had a lasting impact on the Foundation, and we are sincerely thankful for their contributions.

The Board is elected annually by the [Members](https://innersourcecommons.org/about/members/) of InnerSource Commons, with Directors chosen for their expertise and ability to guide and shape the Foundation’s strategic vision.

“As we enter an era profoundly shaped by rapid AI advancements, the ways we build, share, and maintain software are undergoing significant transformation—and InnerSource is rising to meet this new reality. InnerSource now plays an increasingly critical role: enabling collaboration at scale, managing vast AI-generated codebases, and fostering the development of organizationally unique, proprietary technologies that AI alone cannot easily replicate.

I'm genuinely excited to embark on this journey with our new leadership team and the entire InnerSource Commons community. InnerSource is not something fixed—it evolves through the ideas, experiences, and curiosity that each of you brings. As the world continues to change, so do the ways InnerSource can make an impact—on how we build software, how we collaborate, and how we share what makes our work meaningful.

Your contributions—big or small, frequent or occasional—help InnerSource grow and adapt. And that’s what makes this community such an exciting space to be in. Let’s keep exploring together, learning from each other, and enjoying what we build along the way.”  
 — **Yuki Hattori, President of the InnerSource Commons Foundation**
