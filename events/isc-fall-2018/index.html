Inner source is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software. While simple to define, inner source can be difficult to explain and implement successfully.
Many engineers lack the background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development. Even those with that background face a new set of constraints and motivations when trying to work openly within the enterprise.
<p>The Inner Source Learning path gives a simple, easy to understand introduction to inner source. It introduces key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples. It is intended to bring newcomers up to speed as well as provide those with experience a common vocabulary to use when discussing more advanced concepts.</p>
<p>The Inner Source Learning path will be freely hosted by O&rsquo;Reilly Media at <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/learning-paths">https://www.safaribooksonline.com/learning-paths</a> for your use and sharing. More advanced segments of the learning path are forthcoming, and we&rsquo;ll outline how you can get involved.         <br>

Establishing an InnerSource program inherently implies creating a supply and demand scenario.  Failing to satisfy the needs of this marketplace can fundamentally limit your program&rsquo;s effectiveness.  Creating systems of discoverability that allow project owners to easily connect with potential contributors can yield unexpected benefits.

Those of us establishing InnerSource programs encounter similar problems. Developing Patterns is a way of capturing proven solutions to these problems.  This workshop will provide a brief introduction of the InnerSource patterns, and the standard components of patterns. Then we’ll break out into groups to draft patterns for pervasive problems.  Let’s work together and provide solutions for the larger community!

In 2013, a number of employees at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory believed that the tools that were so successfully supporting the open source community could have significant benefits for our software development community at JPL. Core to this belief was the theory that the JPL software development community was similar to the open source community in the way it operates. This theory has been put into practice in a number of companies, and is known as InnerSource.<br>

&ldquo;Inner source is a great idea! Go do inner source!&rdquo; You&rsquo;re the dedicated champion for inner source in your company. What do you do now? How do you realistically affect the behavior of dozens or hundreds of teams to the point where robust and pervasive inner sourcing is a normal part of the way that engineering is done? This presentation shares principles, practical anecdotes, and relatable examples on this situation gleaned from experience at Nike. While not claiming all of the answers, it is insightful summary of over a year of work in the area.

<span onClick="toggleAbstract('hook-1')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="hook-1-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span>
<div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="hook-1">
I’ve long been a proponent of software reuse, sharing, and breaking down of silos, but it wasn’t until this year (2018) that I was introduced to InnerSource as a formal concept. At the same time, my company was advertising internally for somebody to start building an InnerSource program internally. I felt that it was a position designed for me.
This talk is about the 9-month journey I’ve had since the beginning of the year. During this time, I’ve encountered people all over our global organization. Most of them are overwhelmingly positive about this concept of InnerSource. Fortunately, I’m in an environment where it’s not only supported by upper management but being actively encouraged. At the ISC Spring Summit, I met several people who were interested in starting up an InnerSource program, but not sure what to do first. This presentation is designed to kickstart offline discussion around a future series of talks related to how to start a program.

At Nike, we've chosen a bottom-up, grass roots strategy for our InnerSource effort. We strive to achieve horizontal adoption of InnerSource tools and practice before advocating up Nike's organizational hierarchy. Recent work in social networks and network dynamics suggest there is more than intuition and anecdotes behind this strategy. In this session, we will review the science behind behavior change and connect the theoretical and experimental evidence to our own experience running an InnerSource effort.

In this session, I will deep-dive into the issues that engineering silos cause at large financial tech companies. Silos limit innovation, cause less collaboration amongst engineering teams, contribute to a lack of quality mentorship, limit people skills, and can drive fear to move more current technologies. I will discuss how inner source brings a revolutionary approach to transform such engineering cultures to adopt efficient, collaborative processes, quality mentorship and to create a more organic and innovative software engineering ecosystem overall.

Cheating on metrics is easy. And it happens that from time to time we realize that the metrics that we thought were the right ones, are in reality the wrong ones. 
This talk will analyze one of the first steps that everyone is measuring in the InnerSource initiative, and these are the contributions. There are of course several types of them, and not only source code: reviews, edits in a wiki, or conversations in asynchrounous channels. However, how can we sure that we all mean the same when we measure those contributions? Does a commit have the same meaning for everyone? Have we ever thought about automated actions by bots, merge commits, or people adding tabs to the source code? And even more, is better to measure commits than source code lines? And what about files?

InnerSource - what we call Bosch Internal Open Source (BIOS) internally - is a great tool for a variety of use cases in a corporate setup. One of them being internal training where we think InnerSource is quite a natural fit. The enabling team of the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence has the challenging mission to spread knowledge about AI within Bosch. One of the approaches which we use to tackle that challenge is to build up an InnerSource learning community. Apart from providing details on the first steps we took, we will also give some insights on the preconditions which are key for a successful InnerSource project and give a brief overview about the next steps we're going to take.

Operations teams need to adopt automation to scale. The development background and operational knowledge required to build these automations can be hard to find. We will discuss a pattern that uses inner source to create these automations using an enablement team. The enablement team builds the initial automation using tools that are easy to learn and publishes them in shared source control. The automation is exposed via GUI for easy execution. By having open visibility to the code and easy execution, we can create a culture where the operations team can increase their expertise in the automation and eventually assumes ownership. The open culture enabling operations teams to learn these development skills also addresses a critical gap in the workforce.

At the European InnerSource Commons event, we held a workshop about the documentation patterns that teams and individuals can follow to get better documentation for their projects. In this talk I will explain the background constraints/forces that documentation projects typically struggle with and give a short introduction to the different candidate patterns such as: Beginners teach, Design first, Readme first, Docs as definition of done, Docs as code (with its subpatterns docs in code and docs also in code), Writers become editors, Docs as innersourcing projects, Docs appreciation, Documentation scaffolds, Activation energy, SDK patterns, Glossary, and Docs as sales. I will also explain which patterns I think apply to Innersourcing projects, and do an attempt to create a decision tree that helps you to choose what documentation patterns could be useful in a given company context.

<p><strong>Raimund Hook</strong></p>
<p>As InnerSource and DevOps Specialist at EXFO Inc., Raimund Hook has a corporate mandate to introduce and develop InnerSource in his organization. He is bringing his skills honed from his 20-year career into building tools and trying to foster a community of developers across the business. A technical generalist, Raimund has experience with a vast array of technology from hardware to deep network stacks, virtualization to cloud building, and a plethora of programming languages to several automation frameworks.
A passionate believer in Automation, Raimund believes that there is a solution for most mundane tasks – somebody simply needs to take the time to implement it. Unfortunately, he’s found out, automating people is less of an ‘easy target’. He’s admittedly learning along the way and has found that sharing his experiences is part of the InnerSource way. Raimund joined Ontology Systems in London in late 2015, which was later acquired by EXFO in 2017. Prior to working at EXFO, he spent 11 years working for Internet Solutions in South Africa, a converged Telecommunications provider. There, Raimund held various positions culminating in leading a team responsible for building and maintaining fulfilment and provisioning solutions for the business.</p>
