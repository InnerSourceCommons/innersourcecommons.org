It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p>
<h3 id="code-of-conductaboutcodeofconduct"><a href="/about/codeofconduct/">Code of Conduct</a></h3>
<p>All participants, vendors, and guests at InnerSource Commons events are required to abide by the <a href="/about/codeofconduct/">code of conduct</a>.
