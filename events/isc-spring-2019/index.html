The assessment poses a number of questions with multiple choice answers around the following key areas: Business Goals, General Knowledge of Open Source, Development Standards and Tools, Upstream Community Participation, Governance & Legal Policies and Senior Management Support. The results of the assessment are used as a starting point to give an organisation a better understanding of their business goals regarding Open Source / Inner Source software and methodologies, the focus areas to address (under the areas of consume, contribute, create and strategy/governance) and recommended next steps. During this workshop, we will:<ul><li>Have each individual attendee run through the assessment tool to determine their organisation's maturity</li><li>Analyse the results to highlight areas for an organisation to focus on</li><li>Hold an open discussion on organisation maturity, including issues encountered and ways to increase the maturity level The assessment itself is Open Source and the code can be found at https://github.com/boogiespook/osma.</li></ul>It is a simple LAMP stack, allowing questions and responses to be customised for an organisation.

Agile and InnerSource are defined in both cases and [e.g.: in the Wikipedia] as software development practices. However it seems that it is still not clear how each of them can complement the other. This talk aims at bringing on the table some thoughts on how Agile is being used by some large corporations, and how InnerSource is being applied by some others.

In this talk, we explain how we had the opportunity to work with the CTO, and to support hims with a data-driven approach. After introducing the notion of software analytics, we explain how we have used metrics first to diagnose the problems, and then to support a continuous improvement process. We review a series of specific experiments done in this context, discussing both successes and challenges. We emphasize the human aspects of the transition and explain how metrics can be powerful when it comes to trigger conversations and to drive behavior change. We explain how our initial recommendations were to inspire teams to adopt practices that can be seen "in action" on GitHub. When we embarked on this journey, we did not know about the InnerSource Commons. Nevertheless, some of the problems that we encountered are very similar to those enlisted in the Patterns Catalog.

It introduces key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples. It is intended to bring newcomers up to speed as well as provide those with experience a common vocabulary to use when discussing more advanced concepts.

However, crowdsourcing software development involves complex tasks which differ significantly from the micro-tasks that can be found on crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk—the latter are much shorter in duration, and typically very simple and do not involve any task interdependencies. To achieve the potential benefits of crowdsourcing in the software development context, companies need to understand how this strategy works, what challenges arise, and what factors might affect crowd participation. Research to date on crowdsourcing software development has tended to focus on the ‘crowd’ or the technical platform, with little research from the perspective of the customer who is seeking to leverage the crowdsourcing development model. The findings from an in-depth case study of crowd-sourcing software development in a Fortune 500 company are augmented with an analysis of over 13,000 crowdsourcing competitions over a ten-year period on the Topcoder crowdsourcing platform, one of the most popular platforms for software development, are drawn on to evaluate the effectiveness of crowdsourcing in a software development context.</div></td></tr><tr><td class=time>10:20 - 10:45</td><td colspan=2>Coffee Break</td></tr><tr><td class=time>10:50 - 11:20</td><td class=author><a href=/events/isc-spring-2019-speakers#daniel_izquierdo_cortázar>Daniel Izquierdo Cortázar</a> <span class=affiliation>(Bitergia) and Ana Jimenez Santamaria <span class=affiliation>(Bitergia)</span></td><td class=title>Metrics and KPIs for an InnerSource Office

In this talk I want to introduce 7 mental models and surprising insights that I have adopted along te way that have transformed the way I think about business. I will present the insights together with references to the books from which they were derived, and explain why I believe they can help an organisation to build an open source-like culture.</div></td></tr><tr><td class=time>13:50 - 14:30</td><td class=author><a href=/events/isc-spring-2019-speakers#danese_cooper>Danese Cooper</a></td><td class=title>Governance Meeting

It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href=https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule>Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p><h3 id=who-should-attend>Who should attend?</h3><p>The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer. The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.</p><h3 id=what-will-i-get-from-this-event>What will I get from this event?</h3><p>The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:</p><ul><li>Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption</li><li>Share your experiences and get help with your challenges</li><li>Network, network, network!
