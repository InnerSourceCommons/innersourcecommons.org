### Travel and Transit

Boston is a popular city for events, and hotels in the Waterfront area are mostly booked (and fairly expensive). The Waterfront area is just across the river from Boston Logan airport [KBOS](http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/). The greater Boston area is served by the [MBTA](http://www.mbta.com). There is paid parking at the venue for people that want to drive, but it is also served by the SL2 route on the [Silver Line](http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=SILVER) subway.

MBTA subway fares *in the Waterfront district* are USD 2.75 cash / 2.25 [Charlie Card](http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/charlie/) and allow you to transfer to a local bus for free as well. Getting on the T in outer districts can cost as much as USD 12.50 and may have additional surcharges depending on time of day.

Unlimited passes for subway and busses are available as well for USD 12.00/day or 21.25/week. Check [MBTA](http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/passes/) for more information.
