I've been involved in innersource since the second summit, which Danese Cooper asked me to join.  I have been hooked ever since! 
</p>
<p>
I'm currently the Director of Enterprise Intelligence at PayPal, where I created a centralized set of tools and standards so that teams can innersource effectively across business units and acquisitions, removing years of backlogged features. I'm responsible for Enterprise Search, Unified DataHub, ALM (application Lifecycle Management), Monitoring and Notifications.
</p>
<p>
I re-architected the FDI (Failed Developer interactions) monitoring program to be more accurate, resilient and reliable. I also worked with DevX team on the creation of a Unified Product Model for End to End Developer Experience.
In addition, I open sourced the unified search tool <a href="https://github.com/paypal/seazme" alt="Seazme">Seazme</a>, while engaging with other companies in its adoption outside of PayPal.
