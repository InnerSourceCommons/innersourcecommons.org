## Local run for other Languages (Advanced)

In addition to the above instllation and local run section, the following settings must be made to see translations in other languages.
English is the primary language in ISC and all updates are first updated in English.
So when you select English as your main locale and look at the contents under `content/en/`, you will see all the information.

Since we want non-English speakers to become more familiar with the InnerSrouce concept, the ISC site also offers pages in several languages.
These translations are provided by volunteer contributors, and not all pages are translated in real time.
Therefore, there will be a lot of content that is still in the process of being translated in some languages. We welcome you to contribute to the translation!

However, in order for Hugo to successfully work pages for each language, you need to prepare all the files, not just create translation files for some pages. Otherwise Hugo will return a 404 error. Nevertheless, it would not be a good administrative practice to keep a copy of all the untranslated English files for each language.
Therefore, at this phase, we use GitHub Actions to copy untranslated data from `content/en` to the content directory of each language when the site is updated, and place only translated files in the repository.

To copy the missing files for local testing, run the following command
The copied files will automatically go into .gitignore, so you won't accidentally commit a bunch of files.

```bash
# Create local copy for debug
for i in de es fr it ja ru zh; do
  rsync -rv --ignore-existing content/en/ content/$i/ --log-file=content/.gitignore;
  gsed -i "s/^.\{37\} /$i\//g" content/.gitignore;
  gsed -i '/total size\|file list/d' content/.gitignore;
done
```

When you are done editing, the files you just downloaded that are untranslated and unnecessary should still be in `content/.gitignore'.
the following set of commands will allow you to erase those files under each language's content directory.

```bash
# Delete local Copy for debug
for f in $(cat content/.gitignore); do 
  rm "content/$f"
done
rm content/.gitignore;
```
