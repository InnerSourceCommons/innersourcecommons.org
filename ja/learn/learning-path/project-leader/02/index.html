        <div class="content"><div class="paragraph">
<p>You want to improve your product and deliver faster to customers. You
want to make stakeholders happy. InnerSource helps your team deliver
value and maintain autonomy in a highly interconnected world.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_autonomous_teams_in_an_interconnected_world">Autonomous teams in an interconnected world</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizations try to deliver value to customers quickly. One common
cause for delays are dependencies in the delivery process. As a result
organizations prefer cross functional teams covering customer
communication, design, implementation, testing and operations thus
eliminating costly handovers. To achieve high performance, teams
eliminate waste and re-use existing components. From a team perspective
each reused component adds another dependency outside of the control of
that team. The negative side of this optimization is clear: The team
depends on another team if they need changes in the component used. To
be able to implement those often lengthy roadmap discussions are
scheduled, sometimes leading to the need to optimize detailed priorities
globally. In complex situations as much as in large organizations this
leads to an increase in time needed to adjust to changing business
needs. For very popular central components often there are so many
requests coming in that one central component team runs out of capacity
to implement all of the requested changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In traditional organizations there are only
<a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/learning-path/introduction/02/">two
ways of making changes to dependencies</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submit a feature request/ bug
report and wait for the other team to prioritize that change and
implement it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a workaround to avoid the bug or locally provide
the functionality needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If none of those options is successful typically the issue is being
escalated and decided at a higher hierarchy level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neither solution is particularly satisfying. Looking at Open Source
though there is an obvious solution: A team depending on a component
becomes a contributing team and provides a helping hand to the host
team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you may ask yourself: "Doesn&#8217;t that lead to complete chaos where
people randomly write into code repositories of teams they are not a
member of?" InnerSource comes with a set of roles and processes that
bring clarity to what otherwise would indeed lead to chaos:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each
InnerSource project has a set of Trusted Committers with clear
accountabilities that go beyond simply reviewing code. Trusted
Committers set the rules for contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributions happen in a
structured way:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contribution intent is shared early to make sure the
contribution fits within the Host projects' vision and scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Progress
is shared early so the host team has a chance to mentor the contributor
and guide them on the path to a desired design and architecture. That
way frustration due to having to decline a contribution late in the
process is avoided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decisions and vital communication happens
asynchronously to be able to work around differing meeting schedules of
people in different teams. As a result contributing teams gain autonomy
to fix upstream artifacts without sacrificing the quality of the
component that is being contributed to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a side effect InnerSource provides teams with best practices that
make working in a remote first culture easy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_advantages_of_an_innersource_approach">Advantages of an InnerSource approach</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of working in silos InnerSource fosters collaboration between
teams. Much as in Open Source that means standing on the shoulders of
giants: Instead of building every component locally InnerSource fosters
reuse. It reduces the cost of reuse by providing a clear path to
supporting the upstream team with the work of fixing bugs and
implementing features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much like in Open Source InnerSource fosters a thinking of combined
forces: Components that all business units and product teams need as a
foundation can be built together. As a result all the boats are rising
together: Innovation created in one part of the organization can create
benefits all over the entire corporation. With teams that are familiar
with InnerSource the load to move this type of innovation forward can be
shared by all teams that benefit from and depend on the resulting
components and services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>InnerSource gives your team the initiative and tooling to fix issues
that block shipping features to customers. When done right maintenance
of core components and services can be shared in a well structured way
by a "virtual InnerSource team" that is larger than any specific
product team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In advanced settings those involved understand the value of contributors
working on simpler features that may not directly benefit their
customers - under the condition that it frees the host team to work on
more complex changes that contributors have a business need for.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_does_innersource_replace_agile">Does InnerSource replace Agile?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Short answer: No, not at all. Instead the two complement each other:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well factored and well tested code is one goal of any agile team. In an
InnerSource setting on-ramp times for team members but also for
team-external contributors get shorter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teams familiar with collaboration who avoid assigning tasks are in a
good position to also deal with external contributions in a flexible
manner. They also bring a mindset and communication style that works
well for motivating contributors over whose priority they have no direct
influence. Working with intrinsic motivation instead of directing work
means that host teams have the tools to successfully collaborate with
contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teams pairing to work on problems are already comfortable with sharing
progress early. There are two challenges moving to InnerSource from a
pairing only culture: The host team needs to make time for supporting
contributors and schedule that into their planned work. In addition when
crossing team boundaries it is often hard to find time slots for pairing
- in those cases it should be complemented with asynchronous
collaboration. To avoid frequent disruption, host team members often
need to intentionally plan their day more rigorously in InnerSource
settings. Often it is simplest to set aside certain hours in the day or
a day a week for mentoring contributions. Making that explicit at the
team level takes a lot of pressure off the engineers trying to fulfill
their own team goals but also helping out contributors. Another
challenge with pairing is that it allows pairs to move very quickly
together - often at the expense of writing important information down
for the rest of the team. In an InnerSource setting it does take
training to remember to bring all relevant decisions back to shared
communication channels for both, host team and contributors. From a
product perspective that does bring a lot more transparency to the
development process. It also means that decisions that otherwise may
have been taken at the engineering level only are now visible for
everyone involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember last time you insisted that your product be well tested,
preferably with automated tests so deployments can happen frequently and
without human intervention? This goal now helps with InnerSource as
well: Contributions are much easier if contributors can check locally if
their changes are safe. Tests also ensure that the host team remembers
to keep the contributed functionality if they are reminded of the reason
for it by a failing test.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember last time you insisted on your team spending time to follow the
goal of "leave code in a better shape than you found it"? That mindset
helps in the InnerSource model: It makes sure that quality and cohesion
of code remains high even when there are multiple contributions from
different sources.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_common_misunderstandings_when_coming_from_agile_teams">Common misunderstandings when coming from agile teams</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>InnerSource and Agile uses some of the same tooling - for different
purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_impact_of_overlapping_language">Impact of overlapping language</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Issue trackers: In agile teams user stories are a conversation with the
customer. Often the are put as sticky notes on a whiteboard. But also
often they are stored in an issue tracker. As a result issue trackers
are mainly perceived as planning tools, essentially a replacement for
sticky notes on a whiteboard. In InnerSource, issue trackers serve for a
conversation with the customer, but also for communication between
members of a team of trusted committers and contributors working on one
common InnerSource component. Issues in InnerSource become much more
lengthy and wordy than in your average organization. They also track the
implementation history and detailed design decisions for a change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Code Reviews: In traditional organizations code reviews often serve
auditing purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They are done when development is finished. In InnerSource code changes
are shared very early in the process, sometimes when nothing more than a
rough sketch is done. The goal is to seek early feedback and mentoring.
This is particularly helpful for teams that are on diverse schedules and
cannot find any time for pair programming. Often teams have the
aspiration that nobody walks alone - in reality though this often isn&#8217;t
much more than an aspiration never achieved. In particular where
contributions cross team boundaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tools used in InnerSource can formalize this ask for more than one human
to be involved with any change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Focus on written communication: The goal with InnerSource is for the
project to be transparent enough so that developers who are not part of
the team can understand project decisions and follow along the process
of software creation. As a result all communication needs to be in a
place that everyone interested in the conversation can follow along:
written, public, searchable and linkable. The goal is not to reduce
distractions to others - the goal is to make all project conversations
transparent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result direct messages and mails are to be avoided. In order to
make following conversations easier for everyone, messages related to
one InnerSource project should be tracked in one separate communication
channel: The goal is not to reach every person in the team of the
InnerSource project. The goal is to find a common shared room for
everyone involved with the project where they can have discussions
focused on that InnerSource project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Focus on written communication does not mean verbal communication is
disallowed. There still needs to be time for a shared cup of coffee.
Also solving problems together, pairing with others or in person
hackathons are valuable to find solutions quickly. The team needs to
make sure though that all project relevant decisions are kept in
channels that everyone has access to. That also may mean to postpone
important project decisions until everyone is back from vacation or
waiting for another day or two if those working in another country are
now on holiday. This is not only relevant for coding decisions, but also
relates to general project mission, roadmap and direction. Without that
information contributors will have a hard time understanding which
contributions will have a good chance of getting accepted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_impact_of_trust">Impact of trust</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All discussions in InnerSource projects are visible to everyone in the
company. Blaming people for their errors, ridiculing them for their
mistakes, talking behind their backs about what they did wrong is a sure
fire way to kill that trust and leads to the failure of that InnerSource
project. This is particularly important for anyone in a leadership or
role model position.</p>
