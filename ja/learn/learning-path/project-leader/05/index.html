        <div class="content"><div class="paragraph">
<p>"If everyone owns it, nobody is accountable." Traditional
organizations prefer to have a single point of contact in case of
issues. On the other hand allowing simply everyone to make changes
surely will result in a mess that can no longer be maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on that observation each InnerSource project has a dedicated team
of Trusted Committers. Interest in maintaining an InnerSource project
often is motivated by enlightened self interest: A team understanding
that they themselves need the InnerSource project to fulfill their
customers' needs and understanding that opening the project up for
contributions can spread the workload to move the project forward.
Opening a project up for contributions though doesn&#8217;t mean that Trusted
Committers have to accept all submissions. It is the team of Trusted
Committers that sets the mission and goals for the project. They are
then in a position to set direction and decide on change acceptance
accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ownership_misconceptions">Ownership misconceptions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Trusted committers are responsible for an InnerSource project. They
review submissions and mentor contributors."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a very simplistic summary of what the role of a Trusted
Committer looks like. In reality one of the first questions often
revolves around the need to accept each and every contribution. In
particular where contributors have already invested a lot of time in the
contributions can become frustrated when hearing that their work was in
vain. Communication skills are important to make sure that contributors
know roughly what the roadmap of the InnerSource project looks like.
They are also needed to make sure that contributors know to share intent
and progress very early on to avoid spending a lot of work without
results. Last but not least rejecting contributions needs very good
communication skills. To cut a long story short: Even if you are not
writing source code yourself, your support is needed to clearly
communicate the vision of the InnerSource project, to potentially help
when contributions need to be rejected. Another aspect that becomes more
important as the InnerSource project becomes more popular: Review and
mentoring become more time intensive and over time need to be scheduled
into the day explicitly. This does have impact on general capacity
planning and should not happen "under the radar".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand for contributors it is important that code review is
not a last stage quality gate. Instead it is a way for continuously
guiding contributors through the code development process ideally
leading to better results faster. For that to work out in practice there
needs to be time and space for team building - but across traditional
team boundaries. Having at least a vague understanding of the different
cultures in teams makes misunderstandings much less likely and the
contribution process much more smooth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular when host teams are flooded with contributions project
leaders that otherwise focus only on their local team need to take a
more global perspective:
* Help the team understand different priorities
for incoming contributions depending on overall company strategy. Often
not all contributions are equally urgent.
* Another way to help the team
is to take over tasks like issue triage, handling initial responses to
contributors and guiding larger contributions through the process. You
can help your team by communicating to contributors if integration of
the change takes a bit longer.
* When faced with larger contribution
requests teams can benefit from help negotiating with other teams the
best time to work on these contributions. Often that is still way faster
than your team doing all the work on their own. In particular first time
contributors may need some hand holding - in particular for larger
changes. Coordinating the timing around that mentoring can be a big help
for your team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"But we could simply fork permanently" &#8230;&#8203; a misconception where
potential guest teams believe that simply copying the code would be
faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the short term that is true. In the long run it means added
maintenance. As a project leader you can help your team understand why
contributing changes to the project you depend on is in the best
interest of the business: Less work overall. Maintenance for the long
term is taken on by the host team.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_innersource_governance_levels">InnerSource governance levels</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We are using pull requests to develop our component - so we are using
InnerSource on a daily basis". While using pull requests and reviews is
a crucial component, it is just the baseline for InnerSource projects.
Just because two projects you depend on use pull requests on a daily
basis does not mean that their openness to team-external contributions is
the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>InnerSource comes with different best practices. In order to avoid
confusion and frustration for contributors it is important for host
teams to define for their InnerSource project which governance model
they want to adopt. Much like in Open Source these governance levels can
differ substantially.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the InnerSource Commons we provide an InnerSource pattern that
defines at least three governance levels:
* Source code is visible to
everyone - but the team has no time to mentor contributors. From the
outside this may look like your everyday InnerSource project. Making the
refusal to mentor and accept contributions explicit though avoids
confusion from colleagues trying to interact with the project through
InnerSource means. Instead this communicates to those depending on the
project that only feature requests and bug reports can be handled by the
team. Essentially that means falling back to a regular traditional
software development project.
* Source code is visible to everyone -
plus the team of Trusted Committers has set aside time for mentoring
contributors. For these projects patches and pull requests are welcome.
The team of Trusted Committers makes sure that project relevant
communication happens in a written, archived, searchable and linkable
channel. The team also makes sure that project relevant decisions are
taken where contributors can see and follow them. Final decision making
though rests with the team of Trusted Committers - and becoming a
Trusted Committer of the project is tied to working for the initial
project team.
* As above - but the team of Trusted Committers is open to
the idea of sharing write access. This approach requires a process for
building enough trust with contributors for the team of Trusted
Committers to share write access. This is particularly helpful where
there is a long term relationship with contributors. Shared write access
can remove the review bottle neck.
* In the final stage the team of
Trusted Committers is also ready to share control over who gets write
access next as well as project vision and mission. While this will often
result in the highest level of commitment from contributors it also
requires a high level of coordination crossing team boundaries. It also
requires the highest level of transparency when making decisions about
the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To summarize each governance level needs a different approach to
collaboration and coordination
* Increased sharing increases the need
for communication and co-ordination.
* Increased shared accountabilities
can slow down decision making.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_explicit_pointers_for_contribution">Explicit pointers for contribution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is implicitly clear for team members is best made explicit and
documented if the project would like to encourage contributions. Topics
like
* Response times to expect when submitting changes,
* communication
channels to use when getting in touch with the team of Trusted
Committers,
* communication channels to use when trying to follow the
project as a contributor
* governance levels to expect from the project
are all topics that the entire host team has to agree and communicate to
contributors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_impact_on_leadership">Impact on leadership</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Increased sharing of accountabilities for InnerSource projects also has
an impact on performance reviews. In hierarchical settings those often
consider contributions local to the team. InnerSource contributors
however are starting to have an impact outside of their own teams.
InnerSource Trusted Committers have an impact on teams that can be
outside of the scope of their own team. That means direct line managers
are losing a certain level of control. They are also losing direct
oversight. As a result, performance feedback from potentially remote
teams should to be taken into account.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_you_build_it_you_run_it_in_settings_with_high_sharing_levels">"You build it, you run it" in settings with high sharing levels</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common best practice for cross functional teams is a "you build it,
you run it" setup. With contributions potentially coming from
downstream users this best practice seems to break. There are several
ways to use InnerSource in that context as well:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Option number one is
to move to greater modularization and collaborate only on the parts that
are the same across teams and keep operations local.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively
work with contract tests to avoid API breakages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with internal
service level agreements, make contributors sign up to warranty periods
to remove the fear of the host team that contributions break production
systems.</p>
</li>
