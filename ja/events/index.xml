InnerSource was inspired by companies seeking to leverage the methods of open source to enhance proprietary software development by fostering better cross-company collaboration. The pervasive spread of open source software throughout operating systems, cloud computing, programming languages, JavaScript frameworks, and elsewhere has caused a number of companies to invest in bringing these successful methods to bear inside their software engineering departments. This special one-day event is centered around 25-minute sessions detailing the experience of those leading the way in the InnerSource movement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spring Summit 2019</title><link>https://innersourcecommons.org/ja/events/isc-spring-2019/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://innersourcecommons.org/ja/events/isc-spring-2019/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="9th-to-11th-april-2019-in-galway-ireland">9th to 11th April 2019 in Galway, Ireland&lt;/h3>
