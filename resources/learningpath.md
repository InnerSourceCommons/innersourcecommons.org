The Inner Source Learning Path is a series of short videos and articles explaining and teaching various aspects of inner source.
Their production was kindly sponsored by PayPal. The Learning Path section introducing Inner Source is already shot and hosted in the O'Reilly Safari platform at http://bit.ly/inner-source-learning-path.

Once finished, the first edition of the Inner Source Learning Path will cover the following sections:

1. Introduction
1. Product Owner *(coming soon...)*
1. Trusted Committer *(coming soon...)*
1. Contributor *(comming soon...)*
