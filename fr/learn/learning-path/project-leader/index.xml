&lt;p>Planning plays a role in InnerSource in two important situations:&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Contributing teams need to understand that working on upstream code
typically does need more time than making comparable changes to their
own codebase that they are well familiar with. They need to be aware of
the fact that even if the host team does not have to implement the
change they still need to be available for mentoring and reviewing. The
time needed for that increases with the size of the change required. As
a result early communication with the host team is important in
particular in cases of larger changes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>InnerSource and Negotiation Skills</title><link>https://innersourcecommons.org/fr/learn/learning-path/project-leader/04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://innersourcecommons.org/fr/learn/learning-path/project-leader/04/</guid><description>&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Coding and negotiation?
You may ask yourself how these two go together.
In particular for InnerSource host teams it helps to have a few stumbling blocks in mind when it comes to change negotiation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Options for Shared Ownership</title><link>https://innersourcecommons.org/fr/learn/learning-path/project-leader/05/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://innersourcecommons.org/fr/learn/learning-path/project-leader/05/</guid><description>&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>"If everyone owns it, nobody is accountable." Traditional
organizations prefer to have a single point of contact in case of
issues. On the other hand allowing simply everyone to make changes
surely will result in a mess that can no longer be maintained.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Relation to Open Source</title><link>https://innersourcecommons.org/fr/learn/learning-path/project-leader/06/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://innersourcecommons.org/fr/learn/learning-path/project-leader/06/</guid><description>&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>InnerSource is the application of Open Source collaboration best
practices inside of the confines of corporations. This makes
understanding two aspects of Open Source easier for teams through
parallels with InnerSource:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
